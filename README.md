# Greetings, World!


## Synopsis

*Greetings, World!* is a proof-of-concept postcard creator. It takes image input from the user and converts them to a digital 4 x 6 postcard.

I chose to build the Postcard Creator as it felt like the most fully-rounded of the options. It requires a bit of work in front-end, back-end, and design, and creates a finished product one could actually use. It also lets me play around with a lot of what HTML5 has to offer.

#### Developer Notes

*Greetings, World!* is written in ES6 syntax and compiled & polyfilled with Babel. It uses Webpack as its module bundler of choice.


## Steps

1. The user uploads a photo via drag & drop, file upload, or web camera.
2. The greeting card generator determines the shape up the uploaded image and orients itself landscape or portrait, cropping the image to a 4 x 6 postcard.
3. The user can then choose from a selection of designs with custom font type, color, and positioning. They're encouraged to add a custom header and message to their postcard.
4. When decided, they'll be asked to write an optional backside message, as well as some information about themselves, and the recipient.
5. Finally, the postcard is emailed, and the greeting card generator resets<sup>✝</sup>.

<sup>✝</sup> All information except recipient data is saved for easy repetition.


#### Notes

All choices are kept on reset besides the form. This means the user can quickly reuse or edit the previous message on the theme of their choice before entering a new recipient.

All error messages are displayed at the top of the dropzone area for the user.
